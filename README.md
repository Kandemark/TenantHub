## Project Overview
TenantHub streamlines the rental experience for both tenants and property administrators. The platform centralizes all aspects of property management, from listing vacancies to handling payments and communication. It is designed to reduce manual paperwork, improve transparency, and foster better relationships between tenants and property managers.

### Key Features

- **Announcements & Communication:** Admins can send announcements or notices to all or selected tenants. Tenants can receive updates and respond to messages.
- **Complaints & Requests:** Tenants can lodge complaints or maintenance requests, which are tracked and managed by admins for timely resolution.
- **Secure Authentication:** Role-based access for tenants and admins ensures data privacy and security.
